# wordleClone

Worked through tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpby4HiElek)

Using an api to provide a random word

"dependencies": {
    "axios": "^0.25.0",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "dotenv": "^16.0.2",
    "express": "^4.17.2",
    "nodemon": "^2.0.15"
  }
  
My version does not check that the word is a valid word - although I may add this later - this was due to the dictionary api requiring payment at this point. It does check the guess against the provided word.

Learning points for me: axios / cors / .env (very useful) and reminders for node and express
